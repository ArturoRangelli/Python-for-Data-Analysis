# Python-for-Data-Analysis
This is the Python for Data Analysis according to the tutorial series on python programming.net. I modified it for python 2.7.
It includes modifying Pandas DataFrame and downloading data from pandas.datareader for US Housing Market (HPI BenchMark and Mortgage rate).
At last, I have also incoporated a machine learning algorithm (Linear support vector machine from scikit-learn module). With an accuracy of about 80 to 90%.
